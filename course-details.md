When your team uses a release-based workflow, GitHub makes it easy to collaborate on your next big idea.

GitHub releases allow your team to package and provide software to your users based on a specific point in the history of your project. In this course, you'll learn how to create a release-based workflow that is built on the foundations of the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

After completing this course, you'll be able to:

- Build a project board to manage your next release
- Create and commit changes on a release branch
- Create a Git tag and a release on GitHub
- Resolve bugs after a release
- Automate and better document your release changes
